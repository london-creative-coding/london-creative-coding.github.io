Darren gave a welcome, especially to our first-time members and we split into small group for a quick discussion about what makes Creative Coding different from normal Coding. Despite our varying viewpoints, a fairly common theme was fun or humour. That led us nicely to the first talk.

## Jack Wild  and VVatch.tv##
Front-end developer and digital designer [Jack Wild](http://www.isjackwild.com) talked about YouTube for the post digital TV.
Although he's a web developer professionally, he wanted to show his experiments into back end dev. He's using a lot of Node.js at the moment, which he described as JavaScript for the backend of the server. He sees that as exciting because a front end dev can now do some work on the backend using similar tools.

Jack also showed us a work in progress [VVatch.tv](http://vvatch.tv/). It's a big collaborative video playlist built using the YouTube API that creates the illusion of traditional TV by allowing you to 'channel hop' so if you come back to a channel 5 seconds later, you'll have missed 5 seconds of video. They'd used some amazing arthouse b-movie clips for the demo, which added to the fun. He's building it with his colleagues at [futurecorp.london](http://futurecorp.london).

The backend code uses [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org) (a NoSQL) database to cue up the videos at the 'elapsed time'. Each video loops. There's a web socket connection to the server, which is a nice efficient way to manage the communications to the client, or more often multiple clients.

They also have a way to use an iPhone as a remote control for the local host.
It's coming soon and has already picked up some great press reviews. Check it out.

## Adam Heslop ##
Adam's a 3D designer by training and he works at [Jason Bruges Studio](http://www.jasonbruges.com) on design/development of digital interactive art installations, visualisation and content creation. His tools of choice are [Cinema 4D](http://www.maxon.net/products.html), [Python](https://www.python.org) and [openFrameworks](http://openframeworks.cc).

He showed a Cinema 4D plugin he's been working on for interfacing with [DMX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMX512) moving head lights.

He also shared some behind the scenes images and debug screenshots from a recent Jason Bruges Studio project where they'd taken over the top few floors of what's currently Europe's tallest building, [The Shard](http://www.jasonbruges.com/projects/uk-projects/shard-lights).

I stopped typing at this point because it was interesting. :)

## Lighting talks and other business ##
We had our usual excellent selection of impromptu lighting talks at the end of the evening. Someone, I'm sorry but I forget who, introduced us to this excellent work [
cabbi.bo/PhysicsRenderer](
cabbi.bo/PhysicsRenderer) which is as weird as it is amazing. Here's a great interview with the creator, [Issac Cohen](http://www.thefwa.com/interview/issac-cohen).

Thanks for coming down, see you again next month!
